================

This file contains the cohesive energy data produced when invoking the :ref:`compute_cohesive keyword <kw_compute_cohesive>`.

File format
-----------

There are two columns, the first column gives the isotropic scaling factors (dimensionless)
and the second column gives the corresponding potential energies (in units of eV) after energy minimization.
